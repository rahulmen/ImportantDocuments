1. From testRunner we will call static method of Allocator class Allocator.main(parameters) and will pass all the parameters we got from DataProvider.
2. main method will create allocator class object and using object reference will call non-static method driverBatchExecution() which is responsible for all execution.

Important :- driverBatchExecution() method is non static because it is not common to particular class 

==============================
Important Method :-
driverBatchExecution();
===============================

1. 	resultSummaryManager.setRelativePath();

resultSummaryManager is an Object refernece which we have got from ResultSummaryManager Class using getInstance() Method that will return ResultSummaryManager Class Object 
that we have created there.

class ResultSummaryManager {

private final static ResultSummaryManager resultSummaryManager = new ResultSummaryManager();

public static ResultSummaryManager getInstance(){
return resultSummaryManager;
}

}

The return ResultManagerSummaryReference we will assign to local Object Reference.

In Allocator Class

ResultSummaryManager resultSummaryManager = ResultSummaryManager.getInsatance();
