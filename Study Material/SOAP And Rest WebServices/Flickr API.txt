[] - This is treated at Arrays.
{} - This is treated as Objects.

Assertion Used in case of Json :-

1. Json Path Match 
This JSON matches the path with the actual result and in Json every thing is Object so we have to traverse using Object
while working with Json.

2. Json Path Count
This Json counts the no of Object at the particular path.

JsonAsertion where we have to find one Object Based on availaibity of another Object

ParentObject.ChildObject[?(@.Object=='value')].Object

Example1 :- find id  value where title matched 'Hot August Night'.

photos.photo[?(@.title=='Hot August Night')].id

Example 2 :- Find title value where owner is '24536826@N03'

photos.photo[?(@.owner=='24536826@N03')].title

3. JsonPath Existence Match

This Assertion will help you to validate whether particular path is availaible or not

Example:-
photos.photo[12].id 
true

photos.photo[16].name
false
Reason :- because above path doesnt exist in Json xml
